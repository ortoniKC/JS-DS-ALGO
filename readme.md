[1. Binary Search](https://youtu.be/xw_SOm9Tc-c)
 - Binary Search is a searching technique which works on the Divide and Conquer approach. 
 - It is used to search for any element in a sorted array. Compared with linear, binary search is much faster with a Time Complexity of O(logN)

 ### Steps:
 - BASE CONDITION: If starting index is greater than ending index return false.
Compute the middle index.
 - Compare the middle element with number x. If equal return true.
 - If greater, call the same function with ending index = middle-1 and repeat step 1.
 - If smaller, call the same function with starting index = middle+1 and repeat step 1.

[2. Linear serach](https://youtu.be/xw_SOm9Tc-c)
 - In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. 
 - It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

 - Worst complexity: O(n)
 - Average complexity: O(n)
 - Space complexity: O(1)
 - Average performance: O(n/2)
